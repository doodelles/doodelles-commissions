        <p> ཐིཋྀ HI! I'm Em and I love to draw, paint, and occasionally write stuff for my OCs (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞
            I've been doing art for as long as I can remember and have done commissions for the past 3.5 years!
            This site is a basic compilation of my commission information. Here I provide information about prices, 
            payment, what I can and cannot do, terms of service, and examples! 
        </p>
        <p> ཐིཋྀ Please feel free to browse my work and check out my commissions!</p>
        <p> ཐིཋྀ If you're interested, send me a DM on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_emxly_a/">Instagram</a>!

            <h2>FAQ's</h2>
            <h3>What types of commissions do you offer?</h3>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>I offer various types of commissions including sketches, shaded color sketches, and rendered/painted artwork. 
                    You can choose from headshots, half-body, and full-body options, all at different price points!</p>
            </div>
            <h3>How do I request a commission?</h3>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>You can request a commission by sending me a DM on Instagram.
                Please provide me an overview of your request, and we can discuss more in depth when I fully accept the commission.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>What is your payment process?</h3>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Payment is accepted via CashApp or PayPal. You can choose to pay 100% upfront or 50% as a down payment
                 and the rest after the commission is completed.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Do you offer refunds?</h3>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Full refunds are not accepted once I begin your order since by that point I would have already begun the drawing process.
                    If there is any specific reason you need one, please contact me ASAP!
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>How long will it take to get my commission?</h3>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>That's dependent on the commission requested, and my own schedule. Commissions on average take anywhere between 1-3 weeks 
                    to complete. More detailed and complicated commissions take longer than simple sketch commissions</p>
